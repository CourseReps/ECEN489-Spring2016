ABOUT US

This is Project 1 for ECEN 489/689, Spring 2016.
The project is to measure the strength of an EM(ElectroMagnetic) signal in a specific orientation, and record the geological position of the measurement. The orientation and location come from sensors on an android device, and the strength measurement comes from a Tenssy micro-controller that is connected to the android device by a serial line. The android device pushes data into a local database, and also a distant server where the spatial distribution of the signal is computed and reconstructed visually.
