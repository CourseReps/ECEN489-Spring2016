#Project 3 - RF Signal Strength Mapping Tool


##Synopsis 
This project will take the captured signal strength from a Digi Internation XBee device, the current geographical location (Lat/Long), 
the orientation of the antenna and current time/date and store the store the data into a MySQL database located on a remote server.  This application will
be deployed on an Android device, such as the Nexus 6P.  The application shall be able to store the sampled data in a local data store (SQLite) until such time
as the device is connected to the server to upload the data.  Also, this application will display the current RSSI, location, and orientation data and will support
timed sampled acqusition at a specified sampling range (10 Hz, 5 Hz, 1 Hz, 5 sec 10 sec, 20 sec, and 30 sec).
