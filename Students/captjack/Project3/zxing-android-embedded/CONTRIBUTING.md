## Reporting an issue

Please include the following details when reporting a bug:

* Which version of the library are you using? (e.g. 3.0.0)
* Which phone/tablet are you using, and which Android version does it run? (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S5,
  Android 5.0)
* Does the same happen on other devices or an emulator?
* Can you reproduce the error in the sample project included with the library? If not, can you
  provide your own sample project or sample code that produces this error?

If the app crashes, please include a stacktrace. Android Studio has a log window for this,
otherwise you can use the `adb logcat` command-line tool.

doesn't scan, or a format is not supported), should be reported at
