Hello,

You will find on our repository Assignment 1 and Opt-Out Challenge 1.  The first assignment should be rather straightforward.  You should write your answers directly on a printed copy of the question sheet;  it will be used to grade your solution. In addition, you will need to submit your Java code through GitHub.

Cheers,
Jean-Francois Chamberland, Gregory Huff
