##Here is a starting template for Doxygen commenting

First example is for commenting of a file.
```
/** 
* @file Example.java 
* 
* @brief A short description of the file - what does it contain, what is it's purpose, ... 
* 
**/
```
Second example is for commenting of a class
```
/** 
* @class Example 
* 
* @brief A short description of the class 
* 
* A more detailed class description 
*/ 
```
Third example is for commenting of a function
```
/** 
* @fn function name
* @brief A short function description 
* 
* A more detailed function description (Only use detailed description if the function needs explanation otherwise your brief description * should suffice)
*/ 
```

inline variable commenting
```
int var; /*!< Detailed description after the member */
```
