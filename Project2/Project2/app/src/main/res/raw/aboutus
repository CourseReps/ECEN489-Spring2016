ABOUT US

This is Project 2 for ECEN 489/689, Spring 2016 at Texas A&M University.
The project is to measure the strength of an EM(ElectroMagnetic) signal in a specific orientation, and record the geographical position of the measurement. The orientation and location come from sensors on an Android device, and the strength measurement comes from a Teensy 3.1 micro-controller that is connected to the Android device by a serial line. The Android device pushes data into a local database, and also a remote server where the spatial distribution of the signal is computed and reconstructed visually.
