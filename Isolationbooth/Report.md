*    App  
        The app is very simplistic in its function and in its UI. The UI is completely blank since there is no user. The app keeps the phone screen on and waits for a request from the server in our case the intel NUC. Once a request is received, the android device takes a photo using the camera class and sends that photo back to the server. The app is now done with its job.
